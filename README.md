## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

My name is Karol JÄ™drzejak. I have been interested in computer science and robotics since I was a child. I started my education in these fields in high school in an IT class. Then I completed studies in the Automation and Robotics profile, obtaining a master's degree in engineering. Currently, I work at Technika Spawalnicza as a programmer and robotization specialist. In current job, i deal with both programming CRM web applications (laravel, php, mysql, bootstrap) and programming industrial robots. My main interests outside of work are running and music. I play guitar and sing in a rock band. I collect vinyl records. I like playing board and card games (MTG) with my friends. In my free time, I watch old science fiction and horror movies from the 80s and 90s and learn new things related to programming.
